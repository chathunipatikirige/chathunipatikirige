🧑‍🔬 As an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering undergraduate from [Sri Lanka Technological Campus](www.sltc.ac.lk), I'm interested in all things electronic and programming related. I spend most of my time working on my campus work, developing engineering designs at my workplace and writing different pieces of code in my free time. I also like to fix electronic equipment and even design my own if I get the chance. I am especially keen in wireless technology and telecommunication industry.

## 💜 Social Media

⚡I am on most of the social media on the internet. I share interesting things related to electronics, tech and programming. I also share my own work, not to mention the blog posts I write. Sometimes you might find some other things as well.

## 🐾 Github Footprint

⚡I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with others. This is why I share most of my work on Github for others to see. My hope is that some day someone will find my work useful.

## 📈 Github Performance

⚡I do my best to keep a healthy work-life balance. Since I'm still a student who also has to work full-time, I sometimes find it hard to maintain all other aspects of my life in balance which results in a decline in Github activity. However, I do my best to keep this balance and to not disrupt the flow.

## 🏆 Github Achievements
⚡ With the free time I have, I always try to do something valuable for myself and for others. These content I upload to Github has allowed me to achieve quite a lot within a very small amount of time. These small achievements make me motivated to continue expanding my skillset and to share more and more with others on the internet. I hope I'm able to continue this all throughout my journey as an engineer.

## 💡Highlight Projects

⚡These are some of the projects that I'm really proud of. I put a lot of effort into them since they can improve my knowledge on certain technologies. I plan to add more projects to this list and to continue developing these even further.

### 01. 🚘 Metroparking
The main problem identified is the inefficiency of parking implementations. Metroparking is a next level smart parking system that automates the process of reserving, paying and managing parking services in urban parking providers. It is an IoT based project that uses electronics, autonomous and cloud technologies to create a fully automated system to handle parking.
- *Key Technologies* - ⌨️ JavaScript | 📱 HTML | 🐘 PHP | 🎨 CSS | ♾️ Arduino | 🖥️ Visual C#
- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [Metroparking](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Metroparking)

### 02. 🤖 Project Bionic
Project Bionics intends to build a bio inspired robot that can mimic the nature. The design, based on the 3D models shared by KILIC on PCBWay, can mimic the movement of a spider by using servos. The complete system is controlled by a NodeMCU and is powered by Li-ion battery which makes it portable. The robot can move to the front, back and can rotate to the left and right.
- *Key Technologies* - 💿 C/C++
- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [Project_Bionic](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Project_Bionic)

### 03. 🌃 Project Almanac
In this project, we try to use a distributed HPC algorithm to enhance timetable scheduling. Since efficiently distributing events across a timetable is an important part of the world to efficiently manage our day-to-day tasks, this project is crucial for the future of efficient timetable allocation. With the use of HPC, we intend to increase efficiency and find the optimal solution to this problem.
- *Key Technologies* - 🖥️ Visual C# | 🐍 Python | 🖥️ Beowulf Cluster | 🖥️ High Performance Computing (HPC) | 🤖 Artificial Intelligence
- *Status* - 🔄 working
- *Project Website* - *Under development...*
